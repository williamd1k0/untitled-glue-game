# Untitled Glue Game ![godot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Godot-3.2-blue.svg?style=flat-square)


A game made in 48h during the Global Game Jam 2020.


## ⚠Alert!!⚠

This game was designed to play with joysticks, particularly with a default XBOX controller, but any controller with analog sticks and triggers should work.

You can test the game with WASD + C for the left hand and IJKL + N for the right hand, but this will result in a poor experience.
